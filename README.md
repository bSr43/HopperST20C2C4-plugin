# HopperST20C2C4-plugin
ST20-C2/C4 CPU plugin for the Hopper Disassembler.

This plugin has been developped for the SSTIC 2015 challenge (http://communaute.sstic.org/ChallengeSSTIC2015)

I have no idea if the instruction set is complete, or not, and I don't think that the plugin will be updated in the future. But, it allows you to finish the challenge using Hopper!
